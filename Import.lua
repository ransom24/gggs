step
	#sticky
	+Welcome to the RXP 70-71 Prep guide!
	+Start with the Collectible Items and Launch Prep Guide chapters, as they will prepare you for all the quests you'll be turning in on launch. Complete them in full, turn in all quests. These are questlines you leave in the open world, not quests you keep in your quest log!
	+Next, do the 25 Quest Log guide, it is recommended you do around 24 quests and not the full 25 to make sure you have room for quests on launch day. Do not do this guide before completing the Launch Prep Guide!
step
	+It is highly recommended you copy your character over to the PTR and give it a test whirl before launch day so you know the route better!
